Flappy bird implemented in Python

Open-source clone of the popular smartphone game Flappy Bird.

The project is implemented using pyglet. My goal in creating this was to build a platform for testing some Machine Learning algorithm(e.x. Reinforcement Learning). This project is just a game, not including the robot. I will create another project to train a flappy bird bot based on this.

How to Play
-----------
Make sure you have installed Python 2.7.x and [pyglet](http://www.pyglet.org/download.html). 
Just enter the source code directory and type:

Have a fun! :)
